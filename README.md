üìù Day 1: Introduction to Basics and STL
Topics to be covered: 

Flowcharts: Visual representation of the steps involved in an algorithm or process.
We'll discuss how to create flowcharts to visualize logic.

Pseudocode: An informal way to describe algorithms.
Write simple pseudocode to break down complex problems into understandable steps.

Variables: Learn about variables, their declaration, and usage in C++.
Understand how variables store data and how to assign values to them.

Data Types: Explore various data types in C++ like integers, floats, chars, and booleans.
Understand when and how to use different data types effectively.

Operators: Introduction to operators in C++: arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.
Learn how to manipulate data using these operators.
